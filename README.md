## Introduction and Background

This repository is for an assignment at "Getting And Cleaning Data" class on Coursera.

The purpose of the project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 


## Course project

1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.

4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


##Steps to work on this course project

1. Download the data from this link and unzip it to your working directory

2. run the code **`source("run_analysis.R")`** and you will get a new file **`tidydata.txt`** in your working directory
